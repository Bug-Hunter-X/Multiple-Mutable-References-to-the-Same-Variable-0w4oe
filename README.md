This example demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable borrowing.  The code attempts to create two mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable `x` within the same scope. This violates Rust's borrowing rules, which prevent data races by ensuring that only one mutable reference to a given variable exists at any time.  The solution showcases how to refactor the code to avoid this error by using a single mutable reference or employing techniques like interior mutability.
